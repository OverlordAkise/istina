# luctus monitor

This is a GMOD ADDON!

Put the "luctus_monitor" folder in your addons folder.

If you want to save your logs in istina but want to use a different logging system ingame then you can use the sv_logs_headless.lua file.  
It is a stripped version of luctus_logs but without ingame UI or commands. It only sends the logs to a webservice.
